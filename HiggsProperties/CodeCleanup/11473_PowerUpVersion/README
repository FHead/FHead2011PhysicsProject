##### COMPILE CODE #####
########################

To use the code, first setup your preferred root version, then do

> make

which will compile everything for you.  There will be 5 executables
in the bin directory.  Even though all expressions are in, this step
should take about 1 minute to compile, as opposed to 20+ minutes
from some other (cough) package.



#######################
##### Executables #####
#######################

There are two that generates the maps, and an additional one that
takes maps and attach likelihoods to our tree(s).  Let's start with
the map-generation ones


##### ProduceBackgroundMap #####

This program runs through bins and generates background map, as
the name suggested.  The map I refer to is P(angles, M1, M2 | M4l),
not normalized.  It takes in a few arguments:

- HiggsMass: An number that indicates which value of M4l we want
- Phi0:  Since it takes forever, I decided to split up the task,
      each program only runs at a certain range of Phi0 and cos(Theta0).
      Here (as you can see in the source file), Phi0 is split into
      12 bins, and cos(Theta0) is split into 18 bins.  This specifies
      the central value (bin center) of Phi0 this program should run
      on.  During the actual map generation, for each sample we
      randomize Phi0 within the bin around this value.
- cos(Theta0):  Similar to Phi0.
- Tag:  A string that distinguishes between different runs.  This
      is only used in filenames.
- SuppressHeader:  Either 'Y' or 'N'.  If the value is 'N', we
      print out a header section in the output file documenting the
      range and bin counts in different dimensions.  We should only
      have one header in the very beginning (ie., first job).
      The nice thing about having header is that it's more flexible
      on map dimensionalities, we can use more bins on cos(theta0)
      for background than for signal for example.


The output will be 7 text files, each with different content:

- EffMEE: final map (full ME) with detector effects folded in.
- Eff: map with only detector effects and flat ME expressions.
- EffMEA: detector effects with ME expression ZZ+ZA (no interference)
- EffMEB: detector effects with ME expression ZZ+ZA
- EffMEC: detector effects with ME expression ZZ
- EffMED: detector effects with ME expression ZA
- MEE: full ME expression without detector effects


To make a map, we run 12x18 times this program, and concatenate the
output file of same type to make our map for one 4l mass.  Then
we repeat for different masses.  Usually I run over masses of 100, 110,
120, 125, 130, 140, 160, 200, 300 and 400.  If in the future we want
to do this for high masses too, we can also run more.



##### ProduceSignalMap #####

This program is very similar to the background one, except that it makes
signal maps.  There are a few differences:

1. Number of bins in Phi0 and cos(Theta0) are 10x12 only, since we expect
      that signals are flat (ME) in these directions.  Instead, I made
      more bins in other directions.
2. Output files are different:
   - Efficiency: Only detector effects
   - PhaseSpace: only phase space of ZZ (other parts of ME is constant)
      with detector effects
   - Scalar: scalar expression with detector effects
   - Pseudoscalar: pseudoscalar expression with detector effects
3. Some difference in the spectrum

Otherwise these are the same.



##### AttachLikelihood #####

As the name suggests, it takes in our step2/3 trees, and attach a new
branch.  We need 4 arguments in this case:

- Root file.  This is the step2/3 tree we have, for example hzzTree_id1125.root
- MapFileBase.  This is the common part of file name for the maps.  I assume
   that the maps are named as ("%s_%d.map7", MapFileBase, HiggsMass).  It can
   contain directories.
- Branch name.  Name of the new branch we want to add.
- RobertoConversion.  Can be either 'Y' or 'N'.  This specifies which angle
   to lepton 4-vector conversion scheme we are using.  Now by default we're
   always using 'Y'.

This overwrites current tree (at the last stage)!  Make backup of the trees
before executing it.  Note that it only appends and modifies the tree at the
very end of the program when you see the third progress bar coming up, so
killing the program before that won't hurt our input file in any way.



##### VisualizeMap #####

Makes all the projection plots from any map.  More explanation coming soon!


##### ExampleFit #####

This hasn't been cleaned up enough to be user friendly.  Coming soon!


#################################
##### Concatenation of maps #####
#################################

This is how we should concatenate the maps.  Take background maps for example.
Suppose you run the jobs with tag "${iPhi0}_${iTheta0}", where iPhi0 runs from
1 to 12 and iTheta0 runs from 1 to 18,

>
> #!/bin/sh
>
> rm -f FinalMap_125.map7
> touch FinalMap_125.map7
> 
> for iPhi0 in `seq 1 12`
> do
>    for iTheta0 in `seq 1 18`
>    do
>       cat IndividualMap_${iPhi0}_${iTheta0}_FixAngle_EffMEE.map7 >> FinalMap_125.map7
>    done
> done
