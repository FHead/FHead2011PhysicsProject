Introduction
------------

This is the package for statistical analysis


Installation
------------

1. Install python3, with packages `emcee`, `h5py`, `hic`, `numpy`, `PyYAML`, `scikit-learn` (>= 0.18), `scipy`, `pandas`, `pathlib`, `hsluv`, `matplotlib`.  Use pip to install them if needed

2. If you don't have R, download R from [here](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/)

3. Open an R Console instance by opening the R app or by typing R in the command line.

4. In the R console, type the command `install.packages('lhs')` and pick an appropriate download mirror if prompted. To ensure the package was properly installed, type `library(lhs)` in the R console. If that command runs without error, the package is installed. Close the R console by typing `quit()`.

5. Clone this git repository

6. Open Terminal (OSX, Linux) or Windows Command Prompt (Windows).

7. Navigate to the downloaded/cloned git repository.

8. Type: `jupyter notebook`. This will open Jupyter iPython Notebook in a web browser.
In Jupyter, open `Example.ipynb`, and run the first cell. If it runs without error, then you should be properly set up for the program.

9. Execute all cells for an example of an analysis
